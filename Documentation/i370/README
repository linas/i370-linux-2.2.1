i370 port of the Linux Kernel for the IBM ESA/390 Architecture Mainframes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some things work. Most things don't.

Cross-compiling
---------------
  Currrently, the only way to build this kernel is by cross-compiling
  it on a different platform.  You need binutils-2.9.5.0.7 or later, 
  and the patches for egcs-1.1.2 from http://linas.org/linux/i370/
  To build and install egcs and binutils, go into thier directories,
  and type:

    configure --target=i370-ibm-linux --prefix=/your/home/sandbox
    make
    make install
  
  Now you should be able to compile the Linux kernel.
  Alter the following lines in the top level make file:

    ARCH = <whatever>
        with
    ARCH = i370

        and

    CROSS_COMPILE=
        to e.g.
    CROSS_COMPILE=/your/home/sandbox/i370-ibm-linux-

  Do a 'make config', followed by 'make dep', and finally 'make all' to
  build the kernel (vmlinux).  A compressed image can be built by doing
  a 'make zImage' instead of 'make all'.

Lisitngs
--------

To get an assembly listing w/ embedded source lines, for some c file,
try, for example:

      make init/main.clst
      more init/main.clst


Running
-------
Load kernel in real mode, set PSW keys to 0.  
(It will switch to PSW key 3 during boot).
Kernel expects to load at address 0x10000.


Tracing 
-------
The ESA/390 TRACE instruction is used to capture traces of interruptions.
See head.S for details.
