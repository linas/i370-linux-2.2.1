Design Notes:

Memory management:
-----------------
-- run kernel in real mode as much as possible
-- run kernel in primary-space mode
-- do not use secondary-space, home-space or access-register mode for now.
   AR mode with Program Call may be useful in the future to implement 
   a really fast RPC; punt for now.
-- punt on ASN's for now, leave CR3,4 alone
-- place kernel code in storage key 0
-- place kernel data in storage key 3, run with PSW =3 
-- determine size of memory by touching addres until a fault occurs
   (the right way to get size of memory is to query the control processor,
   but we defer this until later.)
