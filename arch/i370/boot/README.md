Booting Linux kernels
---------------------
This directory provides some convenience tools for booting Linux
kernels.

## Booting Overview
Linux kernels and ramdisks can be loaded into VM and Hercules in a
relatively straightforward way. This is done by IPL'ing an INS file.
A typical INS file will look something like this:
```
* INS file to load Linux kernel
* Format: <file to load> [address where to load]
* The elf-stripped kernel
vmlinux.bin  0x00000000

* Boot command line
cmd_line  0x000a0000

* Load RAMDISK at the same address as given in command line
ram_image.gz  0x00200000
```

In the above example, `vmlinux.bin` is a stripped kernel, created with
the `elf-stripper` tool.

The `cmd_line` is a plain-text (ASCII) file, specifying the boot
command line. It must be shorter than 512 bytes. A typical example
is
```
root=/dev/ram init=/sbin/my-foo-init i370_initrd=0x00200000,2048
```
which indicates that the root file system will be in RAM, and that the
name of the initial process is `/sbin/my-foo-init`. The `i370_initrd`
argument specifies where the ramdisk was loaded; it should match the
value in the INS file, else things will break. The number after the
comma is the size of the ramdisk, in KBytes. Note that this is the
*uncompressed* size!

## Automation
The above steps are automated by the Makefile in the `make-ins`
directory. Just say `make` and the appropriate INS file will be created.


### Notes
Caution: Do **not** select `CONFIG_VT_CONSOLE`. Doing so will prevent
boot messages from going to the VM / Hercules console.

### Create a disk image
The only bootable disk images are ext2fs and minix. Neither MSDOS FAT
nor Windows95 VFAT are bootable, because neither of these file systems
support file attributes, needed for special files (character devices,
block devices). Without special files, there is no way for user-land
processes to access devices; this includes accessing the console for
printing and the keyboard for getting typed input.

One way to create a disk image is via ramdisk. The example below
creates a disk image 2 MBytes in size. Note that the `-I 128`
specifies 128-byte inodes; this is mandatory for the 2.2.1 kernel.

Don't forget the `mknod` for the character devices: you'll need these,
so that `/sbin/init` can open the keyboard+console for text I/O.
```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/ram bs=1k count=2048
mke2fs -vm0 -I 128 /dev/ram 2048
mount /dev/ram /mnt
mkdir /mnt/sbin/
cp my_init /mnt/sbin/init
cp otherstuff /mnt/
mkdir /mnt/dev/
mknod /mnt/dev/console c 227 1
mkdir /mnt/dev/3270
mknod /mnt/dev/3270/raw0 c 227 128
mknod /mnt/dev/3270/raw1 c 227 129
mknod /mnt/dev/3270/raw2 c 227 130
mknod /mnt/dev/3270/raw3 c 227 131
umount /mnt
dd if=/dev/ram bs=1k count=2048 | gzip -v9 > /tmp/ram_image.gz
```

Once an image has been created, the easiest way to update it is to mount
it with the loopback device:
```
sudo mount -o loop disk_image mnt
```
