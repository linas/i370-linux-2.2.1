# i370 IPL elf-stripper tool

Hercules cannot natively IPL ELF executables. The `elf-stripper` is a
simple tool that creates a "raw" bootable binary from an ELF executable,
by stripping out the ELF headers. As a result, the binary starts at the
beginning of the `.text` section. As long as the first 8 bytes of the
binary contain a (short-format) PSW, the binary will be bootable by
Hercules.

Build this tool by saying `make`. Note this tool runs on the host
system, and is built with the host compiler; it is NOT an i370 program!

Sample usage:
```
   ./elf-stripper vmlinux > vmlinux.bin
   echo "* INS file to load a Linux OS" > vmlinux.ins
   echo "* Format: <file to load> [address where to load]" >> vmlinux.ins
   echo "* Multiple lines are allowed" >> vmlinux.ins
   echo "vmlinux.bin  0x00000000" >> vmlinux.ins
```
