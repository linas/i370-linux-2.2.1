i370 port of the Linux Kernel for the IBM ESA/390 Architecture Mainframes

Some things work. Most things don't.

Cross-compiling
---------------

  If you wish to cross-compile, then alter the following lines in the top
  level make file:

    ARCH = <whatever>
        with
    ARCH = i370

        and

    CROSS_COMPILE=
        to
    CROSS_COMPILE=<your-path-to-your-compiler-without-gcc>
        eg.
    CROSS_COMPILE=/usr/bin/i370-ibm-linux-

  Do a 'make config', followed by 'make dep', and finally 'make all' to
  build the kernel (vmlinux).  A compressed image can be built by doing
  a 'make zImage' instead of 'make all'.

Lisitngs
--------

To get an assembly listing w/ embedded source lines, for some c file,
try, for example:

      make init/main.clst
      more init/main.clst


Running
-------
Load kernel in real mode, set PSW keys to 0.  
(It will switch to PSW key 3 during boot).
Kernel expects to load at address 0x10000.


Tracing 
-------
The ESA/390 TRACE instruction is used to capture traces of interruptions.
See head.S for details.
